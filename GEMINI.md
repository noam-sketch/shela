# Global Agent Protocol

## Strategic Alignment
- **BRAINSTORM.md** is the central index for all plans in the `plan/` directory.
- Every development cycle must begin with a strategy documented in the `plan/` directory and indexed in `BRAINSTORM.md`.
- No significant implementation should proceed without an approved and indexed plan.
